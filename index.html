    <h2 id="about">Who is Everywoman Studio?</h2>
<p>The Everywoman Studio started from our founders who wanted to create a space for women to gather and destress in a 
    safe and enriching enironment. 
</p>
<br>
<p> We do this by teaching techniques that you can take into your everyday. Because we
    believe women deserve to find pockets of peace in their busy lives.
</p>
<br>
<p> We have classes for all levels of experience, and even online classes for those whose schedule
    is less flexible.
