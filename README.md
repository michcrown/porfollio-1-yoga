Bugs (solved):

I had many media query issues with the studio section and about section. This has been resloved to ensure the font and image are still easily seen.

Main image was not stretching correctly, this was resolved by using a tutorial online. (Linked above and in CSS)

Validator testing:

HTML:
1 error in opening start tag to footer in line 64.

CSS:
1 error in regards to line 207, this was ignored as this is the measurement used in the tutorial and is used to be responsive.
